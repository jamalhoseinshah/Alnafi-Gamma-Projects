Concepts to keep in mind:

    Random
    Variables
    Boolean
    Input and Output
    Integer
    Char
    String
    Length
    Print

Importantly!

Despite the name, the actual “hangman” part isn’t necessary. 
The main goal here is to create a sort of “guess the word” game. The 
user needs to be able to input letter guesses. A limit should also 
be set on how many guesses they can use. This means you’ll need a 
way to grab a word to use for guessing. (This can be grabbed from 
a pre-made list. No need to get too fancy.) You will also need functions
to check if the user has actually inputted a single letter, to 
check if the inputted letter is in the hidden word (and if it is, 
how many times it appears), to print letters, and a counter variable 
to limit guesses.
